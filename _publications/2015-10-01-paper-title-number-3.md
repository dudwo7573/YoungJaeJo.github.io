excerpt: "An intermittent fasting regimen is widely perceived to lead to various beneficial health effects, including weight loss, the alleviation of insulin resistance, and the restructuring of a healthy gut microbiome. Because it shares certain commonalities with this dietary intervention, Ramadan fasting is sometimes misinterpreted as intermittent fasting, even though there are clear distinctions between these two regimens. The main purpose of this study is to verify whether Ramadan fasting drives the same beneficial effects as intermittent fasting by monitoring alterations in the gut microbiota. We conducted a study involving 20 Muslim individuals who were practicing Ramadan rituals and assessed the composition of their gut microbiomes during the 4-week period of Ramadan and the subsequent 8-week period post-Ramadan. Fecal microbiome analysis was conducted, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were assessed using liquid-chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry. The observed decrease in the levels of SCFAs and beneficial bacteria during Ramadan, along with the increased microbial diversity post-Ramadan, suggests that the daily diet during Ramadan may not provide adequate nutrients to maintain robust gut microbiota. Additionally, the notable disparities in the functional genes detected through the metagenomic analysis and the strong correlation between Lactobacillus and SCFAs provide further support for our hypothesis."
