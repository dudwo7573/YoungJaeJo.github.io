excerpt: "Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) shows promise as a treatment for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (rCDI) in Iranian patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this study, eight IBD patients underwent FMT and were monitored for changes in gut microbiota. After FMT, patients showed improved health, increased gut microbiota diversity, and reduced dysbiosis. Notably, the abundance of the bacterium Prevotella increased post-FMT, correlating negatively with inflammation, suggesting its potential role in treating both CDI and IBD. The study underscores FMT's potential in altering the gut microbiome to benefit rCDI patients with IBD."

The study presents a multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay (MTq-PCR) for quick profiling of dominant gut microbial phyla, aiding in Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment. This method is highlighted as a cost and time-effective alternative to conventional next-generation sequencing (NGS), suitable for emergency scenarios and routine microbiota monitoring in UC patients, as well as evaluating potential FMT donors.
