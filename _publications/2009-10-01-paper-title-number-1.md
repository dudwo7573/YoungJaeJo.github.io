excerpt: 'The study presents a multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay (MTq-PCR) for quick profiling of dominant gut microbial phyla, aiding in Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) for ulcerative colitis (UC) treatment. This method is highlighted as a cost and time-effective alternative to conventional next-generation sequencing (NGS), suitable for emergency scenarios and routine microbiota monitoring in UC patients, as well as evaluating potential FMT donors.'
