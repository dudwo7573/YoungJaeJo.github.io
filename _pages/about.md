I am currently a PhD candidate at Kyungpook National University in South Korea, dedicated to understanding host-microbe interactions through Multi-Omics. Additionally, as a part-time lecturer, I teach undergraduate students in our department topics like statistics, bioinformatics, microbiome, and transcriptomics to help them build necessary research skills.

I will complete my doctoral degree in August 2024 and aspire to continue my research as a postdoctoral researcher in a broader realm. I am always open to discussions regarding such opportunities, and this website serves as a portal to introduce myself, my research career, and research interests.

Thank you for visiting my website.

Sinceriely, 

YoungJae Jo.
